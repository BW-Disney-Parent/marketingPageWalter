            <p>You've been planning this trip for months. A chance to take your family to Disney World for the first time! You can't wait to see the joy and excitement wash over their smiling faces. You feel yourself getting excited too...and a little nervous. Will you remember to bring everything you might need? What if you forget something or if one of the children gets sick? Will you be able to make sure each child gets to hop on the ride that they're dreaming of?</p>

            <p>There are all kinds of scenarios where our community could help make your trip better and plenty of chances for you to help out other Disney Parents, should you feel so inclined. Interested? <a href="">Click Here</a> to get started!</p>
